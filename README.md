# networking-protocols-standards
This is an experimental benchmarking for all networking protocols, standards. It was *originally* based on [Filament Group's experimental repo](https://github.com/filamentgroup/RWD-Table-Patterns), []() but has during the years grown up to be a more complete solution with new features. Please see this [demo](https://eantho.github.io/networking-protocols)

## features:

#### :bird: Made for Bootstrap
Designed to be used with Bootstrap 5. If you don't want to use bootstrap, just fork the repo and customize it to your needs!

#### :iphone: Mobile first & PE
Built with mobile first and progressive enhancement in mind. Also built with love and with the help of a fair amount of coffee.

#### :coffee: Graceful JS fallback
In browsers without JavaScript, the tables will still be scrollable. I.e. there's still some responsiveness.

#### :thumbsup: Easy to use
You only need to add one JS-file, one CSS-file and some minimal setup to make the tables responsive.

Dependencies: jQuery and Bootstrap 5.
